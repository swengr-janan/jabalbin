        <h2>Web Scrapper</h2>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "0.9em", display: "block" }}>
          Recently delved into the fascinating world of web scraping and quickly
          became intrigued by its potential. I began by extracting valuable data
          from various websites and converting it into actionable insights.
          Along the way, I developed skills in writing efficient scraping
          scripts, managing large datasets, and ensuring the accuracy and
          integrity of the data collected.
